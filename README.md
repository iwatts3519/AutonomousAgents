# AutonomousAgents
A small simulation of how autonomous agents can work in Java

Within this project there are three main agents - Buyer, Seller and Broker. 
* The buyer has a list of items that they wish to purchase and prices they are willing to pay 
* The seller has a list of items that they sell and maximum and minimum prices
* The Broker negotiates the selling and buying process.
