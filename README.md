# AutonomousAgents
A small simulation of how autonomous agents can work in Java

Within this project there are three main agents - Buyer, Seller and Broker. 
* The **buyer** has a list of **items** that they wish to purchase and prices they are willing to pay, and places an **order** with the Broker
* The **seller** has a list of **items** that they sell and maximum and minimum prices
* The **broker** negotiates the selling and buying process.
